# PYNQ Overlay implementation flow based on Vivado HLx Tools

Creation from HLS to Pynq for calculus of the Prime Number and testing the time execution.<br>
This work was developed during the winter class given at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, with professors [Carlos Valderrama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cavalderramasakuyama/?ppe=1) and [Samuel Xavier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelxs/).
